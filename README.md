# Note Encrypt App

Problem Statement
Current app lock delivers fingerprint access along with a number pin. 
So, if a third person somehow managed to obtain a number pin, he can easily access all notes stored.


Objectives
To provide an app that allows encryption of notes into   uninterpretable text 

To use the biometrics sensor for the decryption of the encrypted notes.

To provide backup of the notes available on mobile storage using off site database as well.

To ensure more security by validating the user only through biometrics sensor without any other options. 

Assumptions :The user’s device should be equipped with a fingerprint sensor.

Value Added
The user’s primarily motive is to save sensitive passwords and pins in encrypted form.
